          <p>Duplicate content can be a big problem for some websites and while there can be multiple causes, one of the most common is the inconsistent use of SSL, subdomains, mixed case and trailing slashes in internal URLs. Some websites donâ€™t even bother to address this issue. Others use complicated redirect strategies. LinkNormalizer puts the SEO in control. You decide what the URL standard should be and we standardize the URLs on your website.</p>
