             Some credible estimates show that more than 90% of all pages available to search engines receive no traffic whatsoever. Nearly another 5% receive less than 10 visits a month. What kind of SEO signal do you think having a website like this sends to Google?  Most website owners spend hours pouring over the performance of pages that receive traffic or page views and virtually none on those that get none.
            THINMATIC uses your WordPress database, Google Analytics and Google Search Console data to help you identify which pages are not useful to your business. THINMATIC will then move these pages into a new unpublished state (and with Link Cleaner, remove/redirect any inbound links to these pages).</p>
